## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

No notes locally or with devtools::check_win_release and friends, but rhub::check_for_cran sometimes produces the following notes, which I understand to be noise:

- Skipping checking HTML validation: no command 'tidy' found
- Found the following files/directories: 'lastMiKTeXException'
- checking for non-standard things in the check directory 
  ''NULL''

## CRAN checks from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fqar/index.html

I have corrected the issues listed on this page and taken step to prevent their recurrence.

* Thank you for your work.
