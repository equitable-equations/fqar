## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This packages was archived due to examples that threw an error when run without internet connectivity. I previously communicated with Uwe about this issue and believed it to be within cran policy. Regardless, the relevant functions have now been re-structured so that all examples and tests run without internet. I apologize for any extra work this might have caused you!

* Additionally, rhub::check_for_cran sometimes produces the following notes, which I understand to be noise:

1. Found the following files/directories: 'lastMiKTeXException'

2. checking for non-standard things in the check directory ''NULL''

## CRAN checks from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fqar/index.html

I have corrected the issues listed on this page and taken step to prevent their recurrence. 

* Thank you for your work!!
